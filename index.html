        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm FiGiLU, but you can also call me fig. </br></p>
        <p>I'm a high school student that cannot find something to focus on to save his life. Thanks to that now i have a basic level of skills in development.</br></p>
        <p>I started off doing animations, but i have lost all my past work files so for now all i can really share is my VFX skills. On top of that i have some basic knowledge of lua (beginner level) and HTML+CSS.</br></p>
        <p>I am currently studying JavaScript.</br></p>
        <p>I do not have any past work due to having just made my portfolio, as my first personal project.</p>
